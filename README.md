## First git status output:

On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   .gitignore
        new file:   README.md
        new file:   hello.py

## Second git status output:

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: Stands for make directory, is used to create new directories
- `cd`: Stands for change directory, is used to change the current working directory in a file system
- `code`: Used for opening Visual Studio Code
- `ls`: lists information about the file in the current directory

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- allow multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously 
- allows documentation of all changes,who made them and when
- allows developers to track what version of their project have been released
- allows developers to merge their work to a primary database
- since you can track all changes, this will allow you to diagnose issues in code by comparing different versions of files

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: Preps a local repository for use
- `git status`: Checks the current status of the local repository
- `git add`: adds files to be staged for commit
- `git commit`: preps files for the push step to the remote repository
- `git push`: pushes files to the remote repository and updates them to match the local repository
- `git pull`: downloads the information of a remote repository and updates the local repository
- `git log`: shows a history of commits so you can search for changes
- `git branch`: allows the ability to create, rename, delete and list branches. essentially used to control your branches
- `git merge`: allows you to merge branches into one branch
- `git checkout`: allows you to update the files in the current tree to match the files in another tree or the index if specified

## My Unique Touch

There are things that set me apart from others:

- I think differently than others
- I come from a background of competition
- I'm highly driven but am still caring and enjoy working with others
- I embrace challenges and love stress
