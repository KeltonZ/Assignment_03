## Second git status output:

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: Stands for make directory, is used to create new directories
- `cd`: Stands for change directory, is used to change the current working directory in a file system
- `code`: Used for opening Visual Studio Code
- `ls`: lists information about the file in the current directory

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- allow multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously 
- allows documentation of all changes,who made them and when
- allows developers to track what version of their project have been released
- allows developers to merge their work to a primary database
- since you can track all changes, this will allow you to diagnose issues in code by comparing different versions of files
